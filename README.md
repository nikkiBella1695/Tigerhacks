# Tigerhacks
This is the code I wrote for Tigerhacks 2022

Tigerhacks is a 36 hour hackathon hosted by the University of Missouri. 
This was my first year participating. 

I decided to write a simple choose your own adventure game in C.
It utilizes a lot of printf statements and if statements, and takes user input for decisions.
