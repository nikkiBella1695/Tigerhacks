# Tigerhacks
This is a short program I wrote for Tigerhacks 2022

Tigerhacks is a 36 hour hackathon hosted by the University of Missouri. 
This was my first year participating. 

I decided to write a simple choose your own adventure game in C.
It has a short storyline that varies based on user input. I utilized condition statements for the majority of the program.
